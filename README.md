# Topsis-Text-Summarization

In this assignment we had to apply topsis to find the best pre-trained model for Text-Summarization

The dataset was taken from hugging face

The original dataset was having 12500 rows. I reduced the size of rows for the sake of simplicity and reducing training time.

# 4 parameters for Text Summarization
## 1. Bleu Score

## 2. Semantic Coherence

## 3.Factual Accuracy

## 4.Content Coverage

# 5 Pretrained Model

# Topsis
The results were stored in evaluation_results.csv

On this csv file Topsis was performed and Models were ranked

The result with topsis was stored in Topsis.csv

The Graph of each model and its topsis score is as follows
